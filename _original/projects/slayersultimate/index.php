The novels had been serialized in Dragon Magazine, and were later adapted into several manga titles, televised anime series, anime films, OVA series, role-playing video games, and other media.

Using powerful magic and swordsmanship they battle overreaching wizards, demons seeking to destroy the world, and an occasional hapless gang of bandits.
