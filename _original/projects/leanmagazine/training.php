			<h4>Burn Your Core</h4>
	
			<p class="column7 rightside">You&apos;ve been obsessing over your abs for almost two decades. That ends now. Because we laid out one of the best ab workouts for women 
to kick those elusive buggers out of hiding. Finally, why&apos;s our plan so effective? Because it hits your entire core — not just your ab muscles but the muscles that support the 
spine — from all angles with a variety of moves that challenge your stability, balance, and rotational strength. As for results: Do the moves two to three nonconsecutive days a week and 
you&apos;ll notice a flat-out hot difference in just 30 days. </p>

	<p> This is a fairly advanced routine, and beginners should use caution and start out using one set of each exercise, and slowly add in more work until you can complete the workout in a reasonable time for your current level of fitness. To keep track of your progress, use a stopwatch and see how long it takes you to complete the workout in week one and shoot for a better time the following week.</p>
