	<h3>Stroke Order Basics</h3>

		<p class="instructions"><br>
			Writing is the best way the learn stroke order. Even complex combinations can become easier when written repeatedly in a notebook and muscle memory begins to take over. Remember when you first learned how to write in elementary school and you had to do letter drills. Same concept. With the movement away from the written word to digital typing, you might believe that you don&apos;t need to learn proper stroke order. You are mistaken. Your reading comprehension will improve by leaps and bounds if you take the time and effort to focus on the proper way to write these beautiful characters.

		<strong>2. Stroke Order</strong><br><br>

		From top to bottom<br>
		From left to right<br>
		Middle stroke goes before short flanking side strokes<br>
		When intersecting strokes, horizontal before vertical<br>
		With X-forming strokes, from upper right to lower left, then from upper left to lower right<br>
		A piercing vertical stroke is written last<br><br>
		If the vertical middle stroke does not protrude above or below, the sequence of strokes is:<br>
		upper part, then middle stroke, then lower part<br><br>
		A piercing horizontal stroke is written last<br>
		First the vertical stroke, then the short horizontal stroke that adjoins it on the right<br>
		First the left and upper part of an outer enclose<br>
		A lower-left enclosure is written last</p>
