	<h1>Hi, I&apos;m Desiree&apos;, how are you today?</h1>
	
	<p class="intro2 col1 rightside">I&apos;m a Web Designer, Developer and Digital Artist currently living in Dallas, Texas. I&apos;m a wife, mother and an Air Force veteran. I love building websites and experimenting with cool technologies and I enjoy tinkering with things I find in order to figure how they work.</p>
	
	<p class="intro2 col2 rightside"> I learned a lot while studying at <a href="http://www.artinstitutes.edu/dallas/" target="_blank">The Art Institute of Dallas</a> and through online study with <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/desireesingreen" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>. I want to learn as much as I can about what I have been dedicating my time to everyday. I would love to work in an environment where I can help people interact with technology easily. I spend any free time I have working on my art, attending web events, and hanging out with my family. I give 100% effort in everything I do and I welcome the opportunity to collaborate with others who do the same.</p>
	
	<p class="intro2 col3 rightside">When I&apos;m not knee deep in code, I&apos;m listening to music, drinking tea, hitting the gym, learning a random language (current bucket list: Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese and Korean) and rocking online/console gaming.</p>
